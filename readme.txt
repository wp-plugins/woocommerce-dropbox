Easily choose a Dropbox file to be used as a Downloadable Product for WooCommerce.

== Description ==
The Dropbox extension for WooCommerce gives you the power and ease of use of serving your downloadable products
through the Dropbox infrastructure. Easily choose a file from your Dropbox account via the Choose from Dropbox
